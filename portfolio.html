                <p>"Sneak Easy" is a stealth platforming game that I helped develop as part of the programming team at Spartasoft Studio during Spring 2023. This captivating game emphasizes responsive character movement and Quick Time Events (QTEs), offering players an immersive experience as they navigate shadowy levels, outwitting adversaries with their agility and wits. My primary contributions focused on refining the character's movement and implementing exciting QTE moments, making "Sneak Easy" a thrilling adventure to move around in!</p>

                <p>Battle Blobs is a 2D fighting game created during Spartasoft Studio's March 2023 Game Jam in which the theme was: "MESSY". I was part of a six-person team, contributing as a programmer responsible for some character movement and the paint mechanic. In this fast-paced title, players engage in battle with the objective of covering the arena in paint. The player who claims the most paint-covered territory is winner. It served as an exciting test of our skills and creativity, as we aimed to see how far we could push the boundaries of game development within a mere 48 hours.</p>

In this cooperative game, players must work together to escape a pyramid by defeating enemies and solving puzzles. I contributed to the project as part of the Quality Assurance team, where my responsibilities included bug finding, drawing inspiration from similar games, and testing builds. It's an engaging adventure that challenges players' teamwork and problem-solving abilities, offering an immersive experience within the confines of a pyramid.</p>
