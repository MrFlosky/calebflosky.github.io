            <p>My Role: AI, Camera and Dialogue, Maze, and Player Programming <br><br> "Miskatonic" was a project made in MSU's MI 445 Game Design and Development I class. During this project, I was in charge of the AI, Camera and Dialogue, Maze Generation, and Player Programming. In this game, the player embodies an ancient entity, Labgoroth. Use your powers to manipulate human psyches and cultivate fear. With each move, amplify terror in the AI-controlled humans as they attempt to flee, ultimately allowing Labgoroth to fully manifest once their fear reaches its peak.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I'm Caleb Flosky, and I'm a passionate Junior majoring in Computer Science at Michigan State University. Currently, I'm enrolled in MI 445 at the MSU Game Design Minor. On top of that, I am a Gameplay Programming at Spartasoft Studio, a Game Design Studio club. We're working on a project titled "Grave", a single-player 3D action game inspired by Hades. Video games have always been a big part of my life, and I'm thrilled to be able to contribute to the industry that has given me so much joy. I'm always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts, so feel free to reach out!</p>
