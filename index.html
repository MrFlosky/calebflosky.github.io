During this project, I was in charge of the AI, Camera and Dialogue, Maze Generation, and Player Programming. In this game, the player embodies an ancient entity, Labgoroth. Use your powers to manipulate human psyches and cultivate fear. With each move, amplify terror in the AI-controlled humans as they attempt to flee, ultimately allowing Labgoroth to fully manifest once their fear reaches its peak.</p>

                    <p>Hello! I'm Caleb Flosky, and I'm a passionate Senior majoring in Computer Science at Michigan State University. <br><br>Currently, I'm enrolled in MI 497 within the MSU Game Design Minor, where I'm developing a game called <span style="color: #57C45A; font-weight: bold;">SpellForge</span> as a <span style="color: #57C45A; font-weight: bold;">Networking Gameplay Programmer</span> focused on the spell system. SpellForge is an online multiplayer top-down fantasy game built using Quantum 3, where 2 or 4 players explore a mystical village, collect powerful spells, and battle each other in fast-paced magical combat. I'm always excited to connect with fellow developers and players, so feel free to reach out!</p>
